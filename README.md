Manc.js Remote Control
======================

(Very) simple remote control written during Manc.js meet-up (my first Express app). 

It works only on OS X, can change volume, and play/pause/skip tracks in iTunes.

### How to use it?

* Launch application by typing:
  sudo node app.js
(osascript requires sudo)
* Make sure your laptop and mobile device use the same network.
* Open in the browser http://192.168.1.10:1234, where 192.168.1.10 is your laptop's IP address.
